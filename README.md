## Contribution
Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to the repository.
And give it a star if you are nice ðŸŒž.
To clone and run locally, just run npm i, and set up the env:
- I recommend creating a project on supabase, as you get a free s3 bucket which is needed for file uploads and you get a postgres sql db on top.
- For the emoji AI (which isnt too excellent) you can get an api key on rapidapi: Emoji AI by alexadamski
- I have included an env.example file
